##  Explaining the UI

This view is made based on my experience as a user in using the admin dashboard. Where here the user is immediately presented with a list of products where the user can search based on complete data. Data obtained from existing resources is reprocessed to be clean so that users can view and view, search, or add a list of desired data.

## Features

The features in this application consist of:
1. Search
Users can search for data by commodity name by inputting the desired keyword (case-sensitive).
2. Sorting
Users can sort data based on the lowest price, highest price, lowest amount, to the highest amount.
3. Add data
User can add data to the list

## Todo

Due to time constraints, there is still a lot of logic that needs to be perfected, such as queries for search, component styling, state management, storage caching, authorization, and others.

## Acknowledgements
