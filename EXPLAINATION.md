##  Explaining the UI

This view is made based on my experience as a user in using the admin dashboard. Where here the user is immediately presented with a list of products where the user can search based on complete data. Data obtained from existing resources is reprocessed to be clean so that users can view and view, search, or add a list of desired data.

## Features

The features in this application consist of:

1. PWA

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) can be installed directly on a userâ€™s home screen and can run in a standalone window. These apps run fast and reliably under poor network conditions and can even function offline.

2. Search

Users can search for data by commodity name by inputting the desired keyword (case-sensitive).

3. Sorting

Users can sort data based on the lowest price, highest price, lowest amount, to the highest amount.

4. Add data

User can add data to the list

## Todo

Due to time constraints, there is still a lot of logic that needs to be perfected, such as queries for search, component styling, state management, authorization, and others.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks for the libs from eFishery i.e. [json-reactform](https://github.com/eFishery/json-reactform) for making form creation, input and validation easy.
